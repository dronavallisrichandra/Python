## Description
- This challenge is organized by the UNT Data Science Student Organization titled "Data Rush: UNT's Ultimate Regression Challenge" to spread awareness of machine learning and regression techniques.

- Machine learning has become an important tool in various fields, including healthcare, where it has the potential to revolutionize patient care. By analyzing patient data and predicting outcomes, machine learning can help in disease diagnosis, treatment, and management.

- The challenge in the Data Rush competition was to predict body fat percentage using regression techniques. Predicting body fat percentage can be an important part of a person's health profile, as it is linked to various health risks such as heart disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure. By accurately predicting body fat percentage, healthcare providers can make informed decisions about patient's health and provide tailored treatment plans to help manage their health risks.

## Evaluation

- In regression analysis, different techniques can be used to evaluate the performance of the model in predicting a continuous target variable based on predictor variables. These include dividing the data into training and testing sets, calculating metrics such as mean squared error and R-squared, using cross-validation to assess the model's performance on multiple subsets of the data, analyzing the distribution of residuals, identifying and removing outliers, and determining the importance of the predictor variables. By utilizing these evaluation techniques, one can determine the accuracy and effectiveness of the regression model in predicting the target variable. Evaluation is a critical step in regression analysis as it allows for the assessment of the model's performance in predicting the target variable. It helps to ensure that the model is accurately capturing the relationship between the predictor variables and the target variable. In this competition, due to the limited sample size, we will focus on residual analysis as the key evaluation factor. The residual analysis involves examining the differences between the predicted and actual values of the target variable. To calculate the accuracy of the predictions, we will be using the root mean squared error (RMSE) metric. RMSE is a widely used measure of the difference between the predicted and actual values of the target variable, with a lower value indicating better model performance. The formula for RMSE is the square root of the average of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values.
- By using RMSE as the evaluation metric, we can ensure that the model's predictions are as accurate as possible, despite the limited sample size.
