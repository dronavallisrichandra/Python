Data Analyst,Juniper Behavioral Health,"We’re on a mission to make behavioral health more available and accessible. We're backed by a16Z, YCombinator, Craft, and many others to make this dream a reality.--Building an inclusive culture is one of our core tenets as a company. We’re very aware of the structural inequalities that exist, and recognize that underrepresented minorities are less likely to apply for a role if they don’t think they meet all of the requirements. If that’s you and you’re reading this, we’d like to encourage you to apply regardless — we’d love to get to know you and see if there’s a place for you here!--About Our MissionAt Juniper, we're building software for behavioral health clinicians to improve quality of care. We streamline and replace manual efforts so clinicians can focus on what they do best: providing high-quality care.We started Juniper because we care about impact — the lack of supply for behavioral healthcare means those who need it most cannot access it. We believe this is one of the biggest problems out there today. It’s why we’re tackling this broken industry, and why we want you on this mission with us.For more details on our thesis, check out our write-up What is Juniper?About Our CultureOur mission to change behavioral health starts with us and and how we operate. We don’t want to just change behavioral health, we want to change the way startups operate. Here are a few tactical examples: Diversity, equity, and inclusion has been a priority since day 1. Currently, half of our leadership team (COO + CTO) identify as female, and our cap table includes over a dozen women. We still have a ways to go, but we’re committed to sourcing, hiring, and retaining talent from underrepresented folks in tech and outside of tech. Behavioral health is something we live and breathe — all four members of the Juniper leadership team see therapists every week, and we have a specific mental health benefit to help if that's something you're interested in exploring!

Data Analyst,Juniper Behavioral Health,"We’re on a mission to make behavioral health more available and accessible. We're backed by a16Z, YCombinator, Craft, and many others to make this dream a reality.--Building an inclusive culture is one of our core tenets as a company. We’re very aware of the structural inequalities that exist, and recognize that underrepresented minorities are less likely to apply for a role if they don’t think they meet all of the requirements. If that’s you and you’re reading this, we’d like to encourage you to apply regardless — we’d love to get to know you and see if there’s a place for you here!--About Our MissionAt Juniper, we're building software for behavioral health clinicians to improve quality of care. We streamline and replace manual efforts so clinicians can focus on what they do best: providing high-quality care.We started Juniper because we care about impact — the lack of supply for behavioral healthcare means those who need it most cannot access it. We believe this is one of the biggest problems out there today. It’s why we’re tackling this broken industry, and why we want you on this mission with us.For more details on our thesis, check out our write-up What is Juniper?About Our CultureOur mission to change behavioral health starts with us and and how we operate. We don’t want to just change behavioral health, we want to change the way startups operate. Here are a few tactical examples: Diversity, equity, and inclusion has been a priority since day 1. Currently, half of our leadership team (COO + CTO) identify as female, and our cap table includes over a dozen women. We still have a ways to go, but we’re committed to sourcing, hiring, and retaining talent from underrepresented folks in tech and outside of tech. Behavioral health is something we live and breathe — all four members of the Juniper leadership team see therapists every week, and we have a specific mental health benefit to help if that's something you're interested in exploring! We have to have a sense of humor. Healthcare is so broken, it's depressing if you don't laugh with us.For more details take a look at our FAQs | Joining the Juniper Team!About The RoleOur team is growing rapidly, and we’re looking for experienced, mission-driven data analysts who care about creating positive impact, love solving challenging problems, and will thrive in the fast-paced start-up life.

Experience working with large datasets to extract, manipulate and analyze data using SQL - Synthesis & communication skills — an ability to reduce sophisticated operational subjects into understandable and useful informational summaries and recommendations - Throughput, velocity, and independence — an ability to drive and build projects from 0 to 1.

Data Analyst,Juniper Behavioral Health,"We’re on a mission to make behavioral health more available and accessible. We're backed by a16Z, YCombinator, Craft, and many others to make this dream a reality.--Building an inclusive culture is one of our core tenets as a company. We’re very aware of the structural inequalities that exist, and recognize that underrepresented minorities are less likely to apply for a role if they don’t think they meet all of the requirements. If that’s you and you’re reading this, we’d like to encourage you to apply regardless — we’d love to get to know you and see if there’s a place for you here!--About Our MissionAt Juniper, we're building software for behavioral health clinicians to improve quality of care. We streamline and replace manual efforts so clinicians can focus on what they do best: providing high-quality care.We started Juniper because we care about impact — the lack of supply for behavioral healthcare means those who need it most cannot access it. We believe this is one of the biggest problems out there today. It’s why we’re tackling this broken industry, and why we want you on this mission with us.For more details on our thesis, check out our write-up What is Juniper?About Our CultureOur mission to change behavioral health starts with us and and how we operate. We don’t want to just change behavioral health, we want to change the way startups operate. Here are a few tactical examples: Diversity, equity, and inclusion has been a priority since day 1. Currently, half of our leadership team (COO + CTO) identify as female, and our cap table includes over a dozen women. We still have a ways to go, but we’re committed to sourcing, hiring, and retaining talent from underrepresented folks in tech and outside of tech. Behavioral health is something we live and breathe — all four members of the Juniper leadership team see therapists every week, and we have a specific mental health benefit to help if that's something you're interested in exploring! We have to have a sense of humor. Healthcare is so broken, it's depressing if you don't laugh with us.For more details take a look at our FAQs | Joining the Juniper Team!About The RoleOur team is growing rapidly, and we’re looking for experienced, mission-driven data analysts who care about creating positive impact, love solving challenging problems, and will thrive in the fast-paced start-up life.

Data Analyst,Juniper Behavioral Health,"We’re on a mission to make behavioral health more available and accessible. We're backed by a16Z, YCombinator, Craft, and many others to make this dream a reality.--Building an inclusive culture is one of our core tenets as a company. We’re very aware of the structural inequalities that exist, and recognize that underrepresented minorities are less likely to apply for a role if they don’t think they meet all of the requirements. If that’s you and you’re reading this, we’d like to encourage you to apply regardless — we’d love to get to know you and see if there’s a place for you here!--About Our MissionAt Juniper, we're building software for behavioral health clinicians to improve quality of care. We streamline and replace manual efforts so clinicians can focus on what they do best: providing high-quality care.We started Juniper because we care about impact — the lack of supply for behavioral healthcare means those who need it most cannot access it. We believe this is one of the biggest problems out there today. It’s why we’re tackling this broken industry, and why we want you on this mission with us.For more details on our thesis, check out our write-up What is Juniper?About Our CultureOur mission to change behavioral health starts with us and and how we operate. We don’t want to just change behavioral health, we want to change the way startups operate. Here are a few tactical examples: Diversity, equity, and inclusion has been a priority since day 1. Currently, half of our leadership team (COO + CTO) identify as female, and our cap table includes over a dozen women. We still have a ways to go, but we’re committed to sourcing, hiring, and retaining talent from underrepresented folks in tech and outside of tech. Behavioral health is something we live and breathe — all four members of the Juniper leadership team see therapists every week, and we have a specific mental health benefit to help if that's something you're interested in exploring! We have to have a sense of humor. Healthcare is so broken, it's depressing if you don't laugh with us.For more details take a look at our FAQs | Joining the Juniper Team!About The RoleOur team is growing rapidly, and we’re looking for experienced, mission-driven data analysts who care about creating positive impact, love solving challenging problems, and will thrive in the fast-paced start-up life.

Data Analyst,Juniper Behavioral Health,"We’re on a mission to make behavioral health more available and accessible. We're backed by a16Z, YCombinator, Craft, and many others to make this dream a reality.--Building an inclusive culture is one of our core tenets as a company. We’re very aware of the structural inequalities that exist, and recognize that underrepresented minorities are less likely to apply for a role if they don’t think they meet all of the requirements. If that’s you and you’re reading this, we’d like to encourage you to apply regardless — we’d love to get to know you and see if there’s a place for you here!--About Our MissionAt Juniper, we're building software for behavioral health clinicians to improve quality of care. We streamline and replace manual efforts so clinicians can focus on what they do best: providing high-quality care.We started Juniper because we care about impact — the lack of supply for behavioral healthcare means those who need it most cannot access it. We believe this is one of the biggest problems out there today. It’s why we’re tackling this broken industry, and why we want you on this mission with us.For more details on our thesis, check out our write-up What is Juniper?About Our CultureOur mission to change behavioral health starts with us and and how we operate. We don’t want to just change behavioral health, we want to change the way startups operate. Here are a few tactical examples: Diversity, equity, and inclusion has been a priority since day 1. Currently, half of our leadership team (COO + CTO) identify as female, and our cap table includes over a dozen women. We still have a ways to go, but we’re committed to sourcing, hiring, and retaining talent from underrepresented folks in tech and outside of tech. Behavioral health is something we live and breathe — all four members of the Juniper leadership team see therapists every week, and we have a specific mental health benefit to help if that's something you're interested in exploring! We have to have a sense of humor. Healthcare is so broken, it's depressing if you don't laugh with us.For more details take a look at our FAQs | Joining the Juniper Team!About The RoleOur team is growing rapidly, and we’re looking for experienced, mission-driven data analysts who care about creating positive impact, love solving challenging problems, and will thrive in the fast-paced start-up life.

Data Analyst,Juniper Behavioral Health,"We’re on a mission to make behavioral health more available and accessible. We're backed by a16Z, YCombinator, Craft, and many others to make this dream a reality.--Building an inclusive culture is one of our core tenets as a company. We’re very aware of the structural inequalities that exist, and recognize that underrepresented minorities are less likely to apply for a role if they don’t think they meet all of the requirements. If that’s you and you’re reading this, we’d like to encourage you to apply regardless — we’d love to get to know you and see if there’s a place for you here!--About Our MissionAt Juniper, we're building software for behavioral health clinicians to improve quality of care. We streamline and replace manual efforts so clinicians can focus on what they do best: providing high-quality care.We started Juniper because we care about impact — the lack of supply for behavioral healthcare means those who need it most cannot access it. We believe this is one of the biggest problems out there today. It’s why we’re tackling this broken industry, and why we want you on this mission with us.For more details on our thesis, check out our write-up What is Juniper?About Our CultureOur mission to change behavioral health starts with us and and how we operate. We don’t want to just change behavioral health, we want to change the way startups operate. Here are a few tactical examples: Diversity, equity, and inclusion has been a priority since day 1. Currently, half of our leadership team (COO + CTO) identify as female, and our cap table includes over a dozen women. We still have a ways to go, but we’re committed to sourcing, hiring, and retaining talent from underrepresented folks in tech and outside of tech. Behavioral health is something we live and breathe — all four members of the Juniper leadership team see therapists every week, and we have a specific mental health benefit to help if that's something you're interested in exploring! We have to have a sense of humor. Healthcare is so broken, it's depressing if you don't laugh with us.For more details take a look at our FAQs | Joining the Juniper Team!About The RoleOur team is growing rapidly, and we’re looking for experienced, mission-driven data analysts who care about creating positive impact, love solving challenging problems, and will thrive in the fast-paced start-up life.

We're backed by a16Z, YCombinator, Craft, and many others to make this dream a reality.--Building an inclusive culture is one of our core tenets as a company. We’re very aware of the structural inequalities that exist, and recognize that underrepresented minorities are less likely to apply for a role if they don’t think they meet all of the requirements. If that’s you and you’re reading this, we’d like to encourage you to apply regardless — we’d love to get to know you and see if there’s a place for you here!--About Our MissionAt Juniper, we're building software for behavioral health clinicians to improve quality of care. We streamline and replace manual efforts so clinicians can focus on what they do best: providing high-quality care.We started Juniper because we care about impact — the lack of supply for behavioral healthcare means those who need it most cannot access it. We believe this is one of the biggest problems out there today. It’s why we’re tackling this broken industry, and why we want you on this mission with us.For more details on our thesis, check out our write-up What is Juniper?About Our CultureOur mission to change behavioral health starts with us and and how we operate. We don’t want to just change behavioral health, we want to change the way startups operate. Here are a few tactical examples: Diversity, equity, and inclusion has been a priority since day 1. Currently, half of our leadership team (COO + CTO) identify as female, and our cap table includes over a dozen women. We still have a ways to go, but we’re committed to sourcing, hiring, and retaining talent from underrepresented folks in tech and outside of tech. Behavioral health is something we live and breathe — all four members of the Juniper leadership team see therapists every week, and we have a specific mental health benefit to help if that's something you're interested in exploring! We have to have a sense of humor. Healthcare is so broken, it's depressing if you don't laugh with us.For more details take a look at our FAQs | Joining the Juniper Team!About The RoleOur team is growing rapidly, and we’re looking for experienced, mission-driven data analysts who care about creating positive impact, love solving challenging problems, and will thrive in the fast-paced start-up life.

Data Analyst,Juniper Behavioral Health,"We’re on a mission to make behavioral health more available and accessible. We're backed by a16Z, YCombinator, Craft, and many others to make this dream a reality.--Building an inclusive culture is one of our core tenets as a company. We’re very aware of the structural inequalities that exist, and recognize that underrepresented minorities are less likely to apply for a role if they don’t think they meet all of the requirements. If that’s you and you’re reading this, we’d like to encourage you to apply regardless — we’d love to get to know you and see if there’s a place for you here!--About Our MissionAt Juniper, we're building software for behavioral health clinicians to improve quality of care. We streamline and replace manual efforts so clinicians can focus on what they do best: providing high-quality care.We started Juniper because we care about impact — the lack of supply for behavioral healthcare means those who need it most cannot access it. We believe this is one of the biggest problems out there today. It’s why we’re tackling this broken industry, and why we want you on this mission with us.For more details on our thesis, check out our write-up What is Juniper?About Our CultureOur mission to change behavioral health starts with us and and how we operate. We don’t want to just change behavioral health, we want to change the way startups operate. Here are a few tactical examples: Diversity, equity, and inclusion has been a priority since day 1. Currently, half of our leadership team (COO + CTO) identify as female, and our cap table includes over a dozen women. We still have a ways to go, but we’re committed to sourcing, hiring, and retaining talent from underrepresented folks in tech and outside of tech. Behavioral health is something we live and breathe — all four members of the Juniper leadership team see therapists every week, and we have a specific mental health benefit to help if that's something you're interested in exploring! We have to have a sense of humor. Healthcare is so broken, it's depressing if you don't laugh with us.For more details take a look at our FAQs | Joining the Juniper Team!About The RoleOur team is growing rapidly, and we’re looking for experienced, mission-driven data analysts who care about creating positive impact, love solving challenging problems, and will thrive in the fast-paced start-up life.

Data Analyst,Juniper Behavioral Health,"We’re on a mission to make behavioral health more available and accessible. We're backed by a16Z, YCombinator, Craft, and many others to make this dream a reality.--Building an inclusive culture is one of our core tenets as a company. We’re very aware of the structural inequalities that exist, and recognize that underrepresented minorities are less likely to apply for a role if they don’t think they meet all of the requirements. If that’s you and you’re reading this, we’d like to encourage you to apply regardless — we’d love to get to know you and see if there’s a place for you here!--About Our MissionAt Juniper, we're building software for behavioral health clinicians to improve quality of care. We streamline and replace manual efforts so clinicians can focus on what they do best: providing high-quality care.We started Juniper because we care about impact — the lack of supply for behavioral healthcare means those who need it most cannot access it. We believe this is one of the biggest problems out there today. It’s why we’re tackling this broken industry, and why we want you on this mission with us.For more details on our thesis, check out our write-up What is Juniper?About Our CultureOur mission to change behavioral health starts with us and and how we operate. We don’t want to just change behavioral health, we want to change the way startups operate. Here are a few tactical examples: Diversity, equity, and inclusion has been a priority since day 1. Currently, half of our leadership team (COO + CTO) identify as female, and our cap table includes over a dozen women. We still have a ways to go, but we’re committed to sourcing, hiring, and retaining talent from underrepresented folks in tech and outside of tech. Behavioral health is something we live and breathe — all four members of the Juniper leadership team see therapists every week, and we have a specific mental health benefit to help if that's something you're interested in exploring! We have to have a sense of humor. Healthcare is so broken, it's depressing if you don't laugh with us.For more details take a look at our FAQs | Joining the Juniper Team!About The RoleOur team is growing rapidly, and we’re looking for experienced, mission-driven data analysts who care about creating positive impact, love solving challenging problems, and will thrive in the fast-paced start-up life.

How we're differentWe believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research . This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3 , Circuit-Based Interpretability , Multimodal Neurons , Scaling Laws , AI & Compute , Concrete Problems in AI Safety , and Learning from Human Preferences .LogisticsCompany-wide hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in our office at least 25% of the time. However, different roles may have different requirements - if this role has a different preference, it will be noted above.Deadline to apply: None. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis.We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation based in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.",hybrid,"San Francisco, CA",2023-06-20,https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/data-analyst-at-anthropic-3641219580?refId=x6uQzZqOA3CQJU08UjeToQ%3D%3D&trackingId=qRI9AE43PQb2YUKb1WZRFQ%3D%3D&position=19&pageNum=0&trk=public_jobs_jserp-result_search-card

How we're differentWe believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research . This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3 , Circuit-Based Interpretability , Multimodal Neurons , Scaling Laws , AI & Compute , Concrete Problems in AI Safety , and Learning from Human Preferences .LogisticsCompany-wide hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in our office at least 25% of the time. However, different roles may have different requirements - if this role has a different preference, it will be noted above.Deadline to apply: None. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis.We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Come work with us!

How we're differentWe believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research . This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3 , Circuit-Based Interpretability , Multimodal Neurons , Scaling Laws , AI & Compute , Concrete Problems in AI Safety , and Learning from Human Preferences .LogisticsCompany-wide hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in our office at least 25% of the time. However, different roles may have different requirements - if this role has a different preference, it will be noted above.Deadline to apply: None. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis.We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation based in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.",hybrid,"San Francisco, CA",2023-06-20,https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/data-analyst-at-anthropic-3641219580?refId=jFm4r0wqCOaI%2B8j001wiGg%3D%3D&trackingId=A4P%2FlHeQCfEiNmGrsrPuDA%3D%3D&position=19&pageNum=0&trk=public_jobs_jserp-result_search-card
